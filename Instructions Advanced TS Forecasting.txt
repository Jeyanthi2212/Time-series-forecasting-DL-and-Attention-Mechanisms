Advanced Time Series Forecasting with Deep Learning and Attention Mechanisms
his project requires students to implement and rigorously test a sophisticated deep learning model-specifically, a Transtormer-based model (or anLSTMCRU
ugmented with an attention mechanism)—for multi-step time series forecasting. Students wilutlize a complex, rea-world or simulated dataset exnioting
;easonality, trend, and potential noise. The focus is on optimizing the model architecture, handling time series preprocessing le.g, differencing, scaling, 
vindowing), and interpreting the attention weights to understand feature importance over time. The goal is to achieve superior forecasting accuracy compared to
oaseline models (like ARIMA or basic RNNs) and provide a detalled justfication for design choices. This project tests proficiency in deep learning trameworks
(TensorFlow/PyTorch), advanced data manipulation, and rigorous model evaluation using appropriate metrics like MASE or RMSE on an out-of-sample test set. The final submission must emphasize code quality, comprehensive documentation, and analytical interpretation of the results



Tasks to Complete
Acquire or programmatically generate a complex mulitivarate time serles dataset (e.g., using 'sclpy.signal' for realilstic synthetic data generatlon or leveraging a complex dataset from 'statsmodels' like alrllne passengers data, augmented with external regressors).
Implement robust preprocesslng plpellnes, Including feature englneering (lag
features, time-based features) and data normallzation/stendardlzatlon sultable for
deep learning inputs, 
Develop and traln a deep learning forecasting model incorporatlng an attenton mechanism le.g, a custom Transtormer encoder layer or an attentdon-augmented LSTM). Tune hyperparameters extenslvely,.
Evaluate the model performance agalnst at least two basellne models (e.g,SARIMA and a standard LSTM). Analyze and vlsuallze the resuting forecasts calculate relevant error metrics (MAE, RMSE, MASE),.
Analyze the learned attentlon welghts to provlde qualtatlve Inslghits Into which
time steps or features the model prlortized during predlctlon.
