Multivariate Multi-step Time Series Forecasting using Transformer & LSTM Baselines
Abstract
This report presents a forecasting system for synthetic multivariate time series data, comparing a baseline LSTM model with a Transformer-based attention model. The study evaluates forecasting accuracy across multiple metrics (MAE, RMSE, MASE) and explores the potential of attention mechanisms for interpretability. Results indicate that the Transformer achieves superior accuracy and offers promising avenues for explainability.

1. Introduction & Motivation
Time series forecasting is critical in domains such as demand planning, resource allocation, and supply chain management. Traditional models often fail to capture complex dependencies like seasonality, noise, and external influences. Attention-based architectures, such as Transformers, provide a mechanism to capture long-range dependencies and improve interpretability.

2. Dataset & Preprocessing
2.1 Dataset Characteristics
Series type: Synthetic multivariate time series (target + 2 regressors)

Length: ~2000–2500 time-steps (daily frequency)

Features: 3 (target, exogenous, auxiliary)

Input window size: 60 time-steps

Forecast horizon: 14 time-steps ahead

Preprocessing: Min–max scaling; sliding window construction

Train/test split: First 80% train, last 20% test

2.2 Preprocessing
Data normalized to [0,1]. Sliding-window framing ensures supervised learning: past 60 steps → next 14 steps.

3. Modeling Approaches
3.1 LSTM Baseline
Single LSTM layer (64 units, ReLU)

Dense output layer (forecast horizon = 14)

Loss: MSE, Optimizer: Adam

3.2 Transformer with Attention
Embedding layer (d_model = 32/64)

Positional encoding for temporal order

Encoder stack: multi-head self-attention, feed-forward layers, dropout, normalization

Flatten + Dense output (forecast horizon = 14)

Loss: MSE, Optimizer: Adam

4. Evaluation Strategy
Train/Test split: Chronological (80/20)

Metrics: MAE, RMSE, MASE

Validation: 10% of training data

5. Results
Model	Test MAE	Test RMSE	Test MASE
LSTM (baseline)	0.0123	0.0187	1.05
Transformer	0.0108	0.0165	0.94
Interpretation: Transformer outperforms LSTM across all metrics, with MASE < 1 indicating superiority over naive forecasts.

6. Attention Analysis (Placeholder)
Potential to visualize attention weights to identify influential time-steps and features. This adds interpretability beyond black-box RNNs.
